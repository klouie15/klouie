	<h1 style="color:#F4F1F1;">Kevin Louie</h1>
		<p style="color:#F4F1F1;">A hard-working stand out individual who doesn't really care about making a portfolio, but does so anyway. Rather than studying for several hours to achieve exceeding grades, I've been trying to enjoy life instead.</p>
	<h2 style="color:#F4F1F1;">What are my passions?</h2>
		<p style="color:#F4F1F1;">I'm not really passionate about anything. I've been liking my coding class so far, but maybe that will change, who knows. For now, I'm just trying out new things to see what I truly enjoy.</p>
	<h2 style="color:#F4F1F1;">Work Experience</h2>
		<p style="color:#F4F1F1;">I worked a seasonal job during Playland's Aurora Winter Festival, I was a game operator. Other than that, I volunteered for countless events as part of my school's Leo Club, a club dedicated to volunteer work. Events I've volunteered for include the Sun Run, the ScotiaBank Marathon, and the parent-teacher conferences at my school.</p>
